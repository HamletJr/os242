# General Tips
* Make sure to backup the VM at the end of every week! Save them on a USB, or even better, upload them to a cloud service like Google Drive or OneDrive. UI provides 1TB of free storage on OneDrive, so that is one option to keep in mind when saving your `.ova` files.
* Pay attention to deadlines! Pop Quizzes usually have earlier deadlines than the regular assignments.
* Keep the ATTN forum clean. No need to reply in it.

# Week-specific Tips
## Week 0
* Use `master` as the main branch.
* Format assignment files (`mylog.txt`, `index.md`, etc.) correctly. If in doubt, see repos from previous OS students here: [https://doit.vlsm.org/040.html](https://doit.vlsm.org/040.html).

## Week 1
* Set up a VM per the instructions provided. The PowerShell section is useful to enable using PowerShell to access the VM. Using this method will make doing assignments easier compared to using the VM directly, since it is harder to copy outputs natively on the VM.  
* For pop quizzes, make sure to answer using the format provided. Follow it exactly, including any formatting on text. Use advanced editing to use the `preformatted` style.
* When doing assignments, make sure each file has the correct output. Also, make sure to use the correct format for files like `mylog.txt`, `myupdate.txt`, etc. For `myupdate.txt` especially, make sure this matches the current week. There is a large reduction in points if this file is incorrect (rip).
* The `scp` command will be useful in future assignments, so make sure to keep it in mind when needing to transfer files between the VM and the host computer.
